This is an expect script to operate the IP9258 network power switch from the command line over telnet.

The script requires activating telnet in the setup of the device and setting the IP address and password in the script.

Additional information about the device is available at http://www.aviosys.com/9258st.html.

I have no affiliation with the company, I just wanted to be able to operate the device more easily.
